# Testing out LLMs to Query Databases

This repo is about exeperimenting the ability of Querying databases using natural language. This is possible by leveraging large language models such as OpenAI's gpt-3.5 with frameworks such as LangChain that offers SQL chains and Agents to build and run SQL queries based on natural language.

With this AI technology, We as data engineers are now a step closer in building self service data platforms where we can minimise the amount of time we answer to adhoc data requests from stakeholders.
